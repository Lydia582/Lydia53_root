            <h3>Types of Tarot</h3>
            <p>Nowadays, there are many different types of tarot. Some still use it as a game. Others use it as some form of fortune-telling. The most common types are the Marseille, the Rider Waite Smith, and the Thoth tarot decks. They all have different names for their cards - specifically, the Major Arcana, suits, and court cards. When talking about card meanings, they have different ways of interpreting the cards. For example, Tarot de Marseille typically employs <a href="numb.html">numerology.</a></p>

            <h3>Why Use Tarot</h3>
            <p>As I've mentionned before, there are many different ways to use tarot. Personally, I use it to make sense of certain situations in my life and to make difficult decisions. For that reason, this website will mostly be focusing on the cards' meanings. However, you don't need to know all their meanings to actually use tarot. If you use the Rider Waite Smith tarot deck, it is much easier to just interpret the meaning of the card by looking at the illustrations. I also find it more enjoyable to do so instead of tracking down the cards' specific meanings.</p>

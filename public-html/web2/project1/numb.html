        <h1 id="numbt">Numerology</h1>
        <p id="numbt">Numerology is simply a different way to interpret the cards. Instead of needing to know all the cards and their meanings, we can learn the meanings of a couple of digits, and we figure it out from there. Now, numerology is very complicated, and even I don't understand all of its complexities. There are many ways to interpret numbers and their meanings. Today, we'll start slow by only touching the surface (because if you start trying to understand everything - you'll never be done with it.) Anywho, for our purposes, you can use numerology in two ways: with the Major Arcana and with the Minor Arcana. </p>

        <h2>The Major Arcana</h2>
        <p>Since the Major Arcana consists of 22 cards (and nobody want to memorise that many number combinations), we'll only learn the meaning of the 10 digits. Then, by adding up those digits in one number, we can interpret the result instead. For example, the World card's number is 21. If we add up 2 and 1, we get 3, which is associated with abundance. Now, if we pull that card, we know that it has to do with expansion or lack thereof (depending on whether the card is upright or reversed)</p>

        <h3>Meanings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>0 - Beginnings, purity, innocence</li>
            <li>1 - Manifestation, creativity, and attraction</li>
            <li>2 - Balance, unity, polarity</li>
            <li>3 - Abundance, fertility, expansion</li>
            <li>4 - Structure, stability, sturdiness</li>
            <li>5 - Shock wave, challenge, conflict</li>
            <li>6 - Communication, harmony, mutual aid</li>
            <li>7 - Stagnation, introspection, reflection</li>
            <li>8 - Stability, protection, sturdiness</li>
            <li>9 - Expansion, growth</li>
        </ul>
    <br>
        <h2>The Minor Arcana</h2>
        <p>The Minor Arcana works a little differently. Since there is no "0" card, our base are the numbers one to ten. The numerical meanings are still very similar to the major ones. For the court cards (11,12,13,and 14), we still add up the two digits to get our meaning.</p>

        <h3>Meanings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 - Potential, opportunity, change</li>
            <li>2 - Union, opposites, harmony</li>
            <li>3 - Growth, completion, groups</li>
            <li>4 - Stability, disappointment, manifestation</li>
            <li>5 - Conflict, change, instability</li>
            <li>6 - Harmony, realignment, reconciliation</li>
            <li>7 - Re-evaluation, knowledge, steadfastness</li>
            <li>8 - Achivement, change, advancement</li>
            <li>9 - Attainment, transition, materialization</li>
            <li>10 - Culmination, completion, rest</li>
        </ul>
